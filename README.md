# Programming-Language-Classifier
An aggregator repository for collecting machine learning techniques for classifying between multiple coding languages.

## Dataset:

The dataset is a collection of codes written for various programming languages. The aim of the classifiers is compare and evaluate various machine learning techniques for our analysis. The uneven distribution of the dataset, further adds to the complexity of the problem.

## Machine Learning:

Check out the demo.ipynb and employ not previously implemented machine learning algorithms for analysis and comparison.
